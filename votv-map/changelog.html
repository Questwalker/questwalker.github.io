5/18/2023 1684441938046 (minus ~32 minutes): VOTV Map became public on github.io<br><br>

5/18/2023 1684453321842: Some updates to improve mobile and small sized screens.<br><br>

5/19/2023 1684562278630: (Hopefully) An improvement to the map panning system, which should also fix some bugs with mobile/touchscreen<br><br>

Features/bugs to add/fix:<br>
 > Add a favicon?<br>
 > Map scaling; Map zoom in & out with pinching or scrolling<br>
 > Add a canvas to the map to allow drawing of lines. Hopefully to allow drawing the fences and various other lines<br>
 > Somehow get a orthographic picture of the map to use instead of the current grayscale one.<br>
 > Additional changelog functionaliy if javascript is enabled (timezone conversion?)
