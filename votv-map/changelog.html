<span class="time">5/15/2023 1684130400000</span>: Development on VOTV map started (slowly)<br><br>

<span class="time">5/18/2023 1684440018046</span>: VOTV map became public on github.io<br><br>

<span class="time">5/18/2023 1684453321842</span>: Some updates to introduce touchscreen functionality and to better accommodate small sized screens.<br><br>

<span class="time">5/19/2023 1684562278630</span>: (Hopefully) An improvement to the map panning system, which should also fix some bugs with mobile/touchscreen.<br><br>

<span class="time">5/20/2023 1684568020687</span>: Small css tweak and added some functionality to the changelog.<br><br>

<span class="time">5/20/2023 1684577875713</span>: Added points for the green, red, and blue argemia plushies and the unknown rozital technology<br><br>

<span class="time">5/21/2023 1684654285561</span>: Added points for the glowing blue, cyan, and magenta plushes and the antibreather plushie. Also added points for all 21 chicken burgers, but they'll be disabled until I add a system to more easily navigate the map's points.<br><br>

<span class="time">5/21/2023 1684703990099</span>: Somehow messed up the name of the antibreather plush, and didn't attach images to it either. Don't know how I did that. In other news, a canvas is coming soon.<br><br>

<span class="time">5/21/2023 1684713991486</span>: A canvas has been added! Additionally, the lines for the outer fence and the stonehenge fence have been added too. An icon for the shovel has also been added.<br><br>

Features/bugs to add/fix:<br>
 > Add a favicon?<br>
 > Map scaling; Map zoom in & out with pinching or scrolling<br>
 > Add a canvas to the map to allow drawing of lines. Hopefully to allow drawing the fences and various other lines (DONE)<br>
 > Somehow get a orthographic picture of the map to use instead of the current grayscale one.<br>
 > Add a marker for the green locker<br>
 > Add a marker for the shovel (DONE)<br>
 > Add markers for various diggable things<br>
 > Investigate the monoliths and mark their locations<br>
 > A tab in the information pane to allow browsing and hiding/showing of individual types of points and locating of those points<br>
 > Add next / previous buttons on the image preview (to accommodate touch screen users)<br>
